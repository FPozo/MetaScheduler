 *  A dependency is a relation between two frames at the end of its paths (as the information has been sent to the     *
 *  receiver).                                                                                                         *
 *  Dependencies can be for waiting a time from the predecessor frame transmission to the successor frame to be        *
 *  received. Also it can be that a successor must be received with a deadline of the predecessor frame. Of course it  *
 *  also can be combined both in a single dependency.                                                                  *
